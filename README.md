Everything on Algorithms using python3 

Week1: Basics 
  
  1.Sum of Two Digits Sum of Two Digits Problem
  Compute the sum of two single digit numbers.
  Input: Two single digit numbers. Output: The sum of these num- bers.
  We start from this ridiculously simple problem to show you the pipeline of reading the problem statement, 
  designing an algorithm, im- plementing it, testing and debugging your program, submitting it to the grade system.
  Input format. Integers a and b on the same line (separated by a space). Output format. The sum of a and b

  2.Maximum Pairwise Product
  Maximum Pairwise Product Problem
  Find the maximum product of two distinct num- bers in a sequence of non-negative integers.
  Input: A sequence of non-negative integers.
  Output: The maximum value that can be obtained by multiplying two different elements from the se- quence.
  Given a sequence of non-negative integers a1,...,an, compute max ai·aj.
  1≤i 􏰀j ≤n
  Note that i and j should be different, though it may be the case that ai = aj .
  Input format. The first line contains an integer n. The next line contains n non-negative integers a1,...,an 
  (separated by spaces).
  Output format. The maximum pairwise product.
